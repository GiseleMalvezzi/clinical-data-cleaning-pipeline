# Demo Notebooks for Clinical Data Cleaning Pipeline

## Summary
This folder contains example Jupyter notebooks demonstrating key features of the pipeline on sample clinical datasets. Use these notebooks to explore how data quality, validation, and cleaning workflows operate in practice.

## Objective
Help users understand and test the pipeline using real code and sample data. Each notebook shows step-by-step processes and results.

## How to Run
- Make sure you have all dependencies installed (see root README)
- Open `Demo_Clinical_Data_Cleaning.ipynb` in Jupyter or VSCode
- Follow and execute the cells in order

## Expected Output
- Data import preview tables
- Data validation and cleaning steps
- Quality summary reports
- Example plots (if included in the notebook)
- Cleaned data exported and shown at the end
